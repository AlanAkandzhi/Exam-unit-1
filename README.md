Reflecting on the five MazeCar codes they all are about guiding a car through a maze to reach a goalbut each one does it a bit differently.

Many Turns - The first code makes the car turn many times to find a clear path. It's like trying every direction before giving up if stuck.

Simple Turns with a Car Class - The second code creates a MazeCar as a class and makes decisions simpler. Here, the car only turns once if the way isn't clear.

Shorter Code with the Same Idea - The third code is much like the second, but it's shorter. It's still about the car turning once when needed, just written in fewer lines.

More Choices in Turning - The fourth code lets the car do more â€“ turn right, left, or completely around. This means the car has more ways to try if it can't go forward.

Simple Turns and Tells When Done - The fifth code is like the second, but it also tells you when the car reaches the goal. It's simple but gives a clear signal when the journey is complete.
