Task 1
I wrote this code to help a car find its way to a finish line. It's like giving the car instructions on what to do when it's driving. The main idea is simple: the car keeps going forward if the road is clear. If there's something blocking the way, the car turns to find a clear path. It tries turning a few times to see if it can go forward. But if it's still stuck after turning around a few times, the code tells the car that it can't reach the finish line. This is like saying, "We tried, but we can't go any further." And when the car does get to the finish line, the code celebrates by saying the car made it!
